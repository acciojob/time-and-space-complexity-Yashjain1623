	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with respect to the size of its input. efficient in algorithms denotes their capacity to accomplish tasks optimally.
</p>
	<p>A <b>Space Complexity</b>measures the amount of memory an algorithm consumes relative to the size of its input. O(n) signifies that the algorithm's memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.
