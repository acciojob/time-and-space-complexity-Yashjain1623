	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>
Efficient algorithms prioritize minimizing time complexity, ensuring swift execution even with large inputs. Optimizing time complexity involves selecting appropriate data structures and algorithmic strategies for faster and scalable solutions.</p>
	<p>A <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) signifies that the amount of memory used by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. This scaling ensures efficient memory utilization, making it suitable for handling large datasets without excessive memory overhead.</p>
